    <p>My rabbits, Leo and Tofu, are the two lights of my life. They bring me untold amounts of joy when they wiggle their noses, or flop from joy. After a long, exhausting day of simply existing, there's nothing more calming than laying down in bed with them. Leo tends to be more the cuddly one; that doesn't mean Tofu is unloving, far from it. Leo is just more forward and sociable, whereas Tofu likes to be more aloof until food comes into the picture. I just think this is a great way to capture the depth of rabbits, and how unique their personalities are. </p>
